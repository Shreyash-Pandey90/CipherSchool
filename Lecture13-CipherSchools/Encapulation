        //similarly we can set with help of setter method 
        //whenever we need to get or set the vales we need method so this give more cntrol
        //similarly we cna apply cond. for getter and setter
        //so this is what encapulation provides
        //we cna also meke it read only and write only


        //by encapulating it it easy to test once all
