/*Graph is the abstract data structure that reprsent relatopnship btw the multiple nodes by conn them 
 * wiith the edges
 * 
 * tree is a subset  of the graph
 * 
 * Insta uses directde graph
 * FB uses the undirected graph  
 * 
 * if all the edges have the same weight then it comes under the
 * unweighted  graph
 * 
 * Traversal of graphs-------->
 * 
 * path     tarverasl in which no edge as well as vertices get repeated
 * trial     traverasl in which node can be repeated but not the edges
 * close walk     start and end at same vertex
 * simple cycle        start and end vertex should be same only and other vetrex need nt to be repeated
 * 
 * 
 * tree is alos a directed acyclic graph
 * 
 * garph with too many edges is dense graph
 * graph with too less edges sparse graph
 * 
 * MULTIEDGES example----> like any filgth companies there are multiple lights in btw any twoc ities
